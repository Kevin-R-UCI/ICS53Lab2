# ICS53Lab2

Hi there. Okay, so this is the git repo for the second project for ICS53.
We're going to be writing a shell that basically launches other programs.

There's code that the textbook provides that we can modify to suit our needs.
I'm going to check it out, and then commit it to this repo if that's the
route that we end up taking. I think that's a likely outcome, but I'll make 
sure that it's the case.
